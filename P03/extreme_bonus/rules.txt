Flow of the game:
2 players enter their names and set their passwords.
Out of one deck of cards, the 2 players are dealt with 4 cards each.
Each player enters their password to see the 4 cards they were dealt with and the points
associated with the cards they currently have
Each card has a certain point value associated to it. The point table is as follows :
U - 5
T - 4
A - 3
0 - 9 : The face value. Example - 2 is points
The total points value of a card is given by its rank_point_value * suit_point_value
For example, 3U is worth 3*5 = 15 points
The players are able to see each others' cards for the first time and then never again.
After the players have seen their cards and current points, they have the option to swap
one of their cards with the card on top of the deck. This action is irreversible and the deck
is not unlimited.
Once a player is done, they can select that option from the CLI and only the second player
will be able to continue swapping.
Once both the players are done, the winner will be revealed.
